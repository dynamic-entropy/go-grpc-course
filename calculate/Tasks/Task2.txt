Implement a PrimeNumberDecomposition RPC Server Streaming API in a CalculatorService:

The function takes a Request message that has one integer, and returns a stream of Responses that represent the prime number decomposition of that number (see below for the algorithm).
Remember to first implement the service definition in a .proto file, alongside the RPC messages
Implement the Server code first
Test the server code by implementing the Client
Example:

The client will send one number (120) and the server will respond with a stream of (2,2,2,3,5), because 120=2*2*2*3*5 

Algorithm (pseudo code):

k = 2
N = 210
while N > 1:
    if N % k == 0:   // if k evenly divides into N
        print k      // this is a factor
        N = N / k    // divide N by k so that we have the rest of the number left.
    else:
        k = k + 1

Good luck!
